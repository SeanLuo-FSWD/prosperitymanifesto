      <p><strong>Preface:</strong></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        You are about to read a manifesto on how the fix the increasing wealth
        gap in the Western world. This is not an ideological or argumentative
        piece, but a unique step by step guide based on logical reasoning and
        even some simple math. This is done in the hope that we can have common
        ground and take meaningful action together. Due the scale of the issue,
        even the simplest logical deduction requires that few common
        understandings be laid out first, making this a 9000 words piece. So
        please make yourself comfortable when reading this.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Section 1, Introduction:</strong></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        I'd like to start by telling a tale of two nations. A few hundred years
        ago, China was the wealthiest country on earth, with a GDP accounting
        for a quarter of the world. But behind its wealthy facade hides a dark
        secret: 90% of the Chinese are illiterate peasants. The ruling 10% elite
        have made sure that no peasants are able to read or write, by making the
        Chinese writing too difficult and time consuming to learn. Unlike
        English, or any Romanized language, Chinese characters have no
        connections between how it is written, and how it is read. To become
        literate, one must memorize the writing and then the pronunciations of
        hundreds of characters with no discernible pattern. The purpose of the
        elite was to keep the peasant mass uneducated, uninformed, and unable to
        rise against them.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        Neighbouring China was Japan, who had also adopted the Chinese
        characters, and whose economy at the time paled in comparison. The
        Japanese found the Chinese characters too complicated for widespread
        adoption. Eventually, they used strokes from the Chinese characters to
        create their own alphabet for writing and pronunciation. Now the
        Japanese would know how to write a word, if he knows how to speak it,
        like in English. This seemly trivial improvement was to have huge
        repercussion later.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        When the industrialization came from the West in the 1850s, China was
        still that country with a 90% mass of illiterate peasants, while the
        Japanese have literacy rate of about 50%, comparable to the European
        states. Even more impressively, the Japanese quickly boosted up their
        literacy rate to 90% as part of its industrialization effort. China,
        whose writing system is too complicated for widespread adoption, was
        never able to modernize and was left in the dust.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        In those days, a common question amongst the Chinese scholar was to
        understand how did their country fallen so behind so suddenly? They
        conclude that their country must have been in decline for a while but
        couldn&rsquo;t agree on the cause or symptoms. The problem was there was
        no sign of decline if we exclusively measure the GDP level, as China had
        been the world's leading economy for centuries until then.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        For me, the decline happened centuries ago, when the 10% of the elite
        decided to hold onto power at the expense of the rest. They have created
        a wealth gap between them and the population, and to maintain that gap,
        they have engineered a knowledge gap by making everyone illiterate. As
        such, there were little possibilities for innovation, and when it comes
        time to industrialize, China simply do not have enough literate people
        to kickstart the whole process.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        When we describe modern America&rsquo;s decline, we often cite the Roman
        empire&rsquo;s collapse, which occurred relatively quickly. But I would
        say that we are more comparable to that of the Chinese empire, a slow
        and imperceivable death. The gap between the rich and poor is widening,
        not just the wealth gap, but a knowledge as well. But we don&rsquo;t see
        it, and we keep praising our rising GDP and stocks. Sadly, it is always
        the same mechanism that makes and breaks empires, whether China or Rome.
        Nations adhere to the principles that made them rich, but these very
        same principle will also undo them. I so wish that we can learn from
        history, so at least America can transcend and break this cycle.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        I wrote this piece because I am on a crusade against wealth inequality,
        which I believe is the source of all our societal problems, and is
        unsustainable. I myself am a web developer with a focus on social media
        sites, and can see how automation and artificial intelligence destroy
        jobs in entire industries.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, not enough people in the tech industry cares, perhaps
        because they are the winner in this arrangement. For people who do care,
        whether politicians, thinkers or economist, their solutions rarely make
        primary use of technology, and thus miss the mark as well in my opinion.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        This piece offers a unique take on how to fix the issue, from the
        standpoint of a socially conscientious person with one foot in the tech
        industry.
